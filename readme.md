# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction Kaggle Project (Python, Scikit-Learn)

- Applied machine learning algorithms over CDC’s 2021 BRFSS dataset containing over 300,000 instances and 19 features.
- Conducted data wrangling using one-hot encoding, principal component analysis, and k-folds validations.
- Employed logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost for predictions with GridSearchCV for hyper-parameter tuning.
- Evaluated models’ performance using confusion matrix and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. The ultimate model has a recall score of 0.93 and AUROC of 0.82.
