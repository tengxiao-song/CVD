# ðŸ«€ Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction Kaggle Project Overview

## Project Description

Implemented a Kaggle project focused on predicting cardiovascular disease risk using machine learning algorithms. The project utilized the CDCâ€™s 2021 BRFSS dataset, comprising over 300,000 instances and 19 features. Key steps included extensive data wrangling, one-hot encoding, principal component analysis, and k-folds validations.

## Techniques Applied

- Data Wrangling: Processed and cleaned the dataset for effective analysis.
- One-Hot Encoding: Transformed categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Applied dimensionality reduction techniques.
- K-Folds Validation: Ensured robust model evaluation through cross-validation.

## Machine Learning Models

Utilized the following machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. XGBoost

## Hyper-Parameter Tuning

Performed hyper-parameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

## Model Evaluation Metrics

Evaluated model performance using the following metrics:

- Confusion Matrix
- Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)

## Results

Achieved a final model with a recall score of 0.93 and an AUROC of 0.82.
