# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction Kaggle Project (Python, Scikit-Learn)

In this Kaggle project, machine learning algorithms were applied to analyze the CDCâ€™s 2021 BRFSS dataset, consisting of over 300,000 instances and 19 features. The project involved extensive data wrangling using techniques such as one-hot encoding, principal component analysis, and k-folds validations. Predictive modeling utilized logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, with hyper-parameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV. Model performance was evaluated through metrics such as confusion matrix and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, resulting in a final model with a recall score of 0.93 and an AUROC of 0.82.
